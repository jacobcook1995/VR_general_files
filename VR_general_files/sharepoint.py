    This function takes a configured document root directory on a sharepoint site

    include the relative URL, which can be used to link directly to the file. The download
    url, using the config settings and a Row `f` are:

    Files can only be accessed via these URLs after a user has logged in to Sharepoint using
    college credentials and also has access rights to the file, so needs a Sharepoint folder
    with managed access for markers. That is relatively simple to do. There is also an API
    to provide shared links to anyone in the organisation. Users would still need to log in
    but the access management _within the organisation_ can be omitted. The API is needlessly
    obscure though, so not implemented, but the URLs look like.
